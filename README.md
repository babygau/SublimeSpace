### Sublime Space Plugin:

A Sublime Text 3 plugin inspired by **Spacemacs Editor** and **Sublimious** plugin.

The ultimate goal is to turn Sublime Text 3 into an **Vim-centric Editor**

Why I write this plugin:

 - I want to use Vim with SublimeText Editor
 - I love `Sublimious` but I don't want to remain all custom settings in contact rather than moving them to a _strange place_

### Dependency packages:

- Vintageous
- Power Cursor
- Project Manager
- Ace Jump
- Advanced New File
- Sidebar Enhancements
- Focus File On Sidebar

### Features:

- Universal quit `hyper+space`
- Versatile quit `f d` in most mode
- Remap `escape` to `f d` in `insert mode`
- Remap `/`, `?`, `n`, `N`, and `enter` to use native SublimeText's find and replace panel
- Remap `f` and `F` in favour of Ace Jump plugin, could use in `normal mode` and `visual mode`
- Native SublimeText's Sidebar with basic Vim movement `h, j, k, l`
- `ctrl+j` and `ctrl+k` activated in `overlay window`

### Libs:

- `itertools`
- `functools`
- `importlib.__import__`
- `sys`
- `os`
- `threading`
- `pathlib`
- `os.path`
- `shutil`
